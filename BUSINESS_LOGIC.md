# Business Logic Layer Documentation

## Overview
The business logic layer contains the core application controllers that handle the processing and validation of business operations for the Vault API. This layer acts as the intermediary between the API routes and the data models, implementing the core business rules and workflows.

## Components

### Controllers

#### 1. Agent Controller (`controllers/agentController.js`)
**Purpose**: Manages all agent-related business operations
**Key Responsibilities**:
- Agent registration and authentication
- Agent profile management and updates
- Agent status tracking and validation
- Security clearance level enforcement

**Core Functions**:
- `registerAgent()` - Registers new agents with validation
- `loginAgent()` - Authenticates agents and generates JWT tokens
- `getAgentProfile()` - Retrieves agent profile information
- `updateAgent()` - Updates agent information with authorization checks
- `deleteAgent()` - Deactivates agents with proper security protocols
- `getAllAgents()` - Lists agents with role-based filtering

**Security Features**:
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- JWT token generation and validation
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Input sanitization and validation
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

**Business Rules Implemented**:
- Username uniqueness validation
- Security clearance level restrictions
- Agent status management (active/inactive)
- Authorization level checks for administrative operations

#### 2. Intel Controller (`controllers/intelController.js`)
**Purpose**: Manages intelligence data operations and access control
**Key Responsibilities**:
- Intelligence record creation and validation
- Access control based on classification levels
- Intel sharing and distribution management
- Security auditing for intelligence operations

**Core Functions**:
- `createIntel()` - Creates new intelligence records with classification
- `getAllIntel()` - Retrieves intelligence based on clearance levels
- `getIntelById()` - Fetches specific intelligence with authorization
- `updateIntel()` - Modifies intelligence with proper versioning
- `deleteIntel()` - Securely removes intelligence records
- `getIntelByClassification()` - Filters intel by classification level

**Security Features**:
- Classification-based access control
- Agent clearance level verification
- Audit trail for all intel operations
- Data sanitization and validation
- Secure deletion with audit logging

**Business Rules Implemented**:
- Classification level hierarchy (UNCLASSIFIED → CONFIDENTIAL → SECRET → TOP_SECRET)
- Access control based on agent clearance levels
- Mandatory fields validation for intel records
- Audit logging for compliance requirements
- Data integrity checks and validation

## Architecture Patterns

### Error Handling Strategy
- Centralized error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed error messages for development environment
- Sanitized error responses for production
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and auditing

### Validation Framework
- Input validation using middleware patterns
- Business rule validation in controller methods
- Data type and format validation
- Security-focused validation (XSS prevention, SQL injection protection)

### Authorization Model
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Clearance level-based permissions
- JWT token validation
- Session management and timeout handling

## Integration Points

### Database Layer Integration
- Mongoose ODM integration for MongoDB operations
- Schema validation enforcement
- Database transaction management
- Connection pooling and optimization

### API Layer Integration
- RESTful endpoint implementation
- Request/response transformation
- HTTP method handling (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Status code standardization

### Security Layer Integration
- Authentication middleware integration
- Authorization checkpoint implementation
- Security token management
- Audit logging integration

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Pagination for large result sets
- Connection pooling for database operations

### Scalability Features
- Stateless operation design
- Horizontal scaling compatibility
- Load balancing considerations
- Resource usage optimization

## Testing Support

### Test Coverage Areas
- Unit testing for individual controller methods
- Integration testing for end-to-end workflows
- Security testing for authentication and authorization
- Performance testing for scalability validation

### Mock Data Support
- Test data generation for various scenarios
- Mock authentication tokens
- Simulated database responses
- Error condition testing

## Compliance and Audit

### Security Compliance
- Data protection regulations compliance
- Access control audit trails
- Security incident logging
- Vulnerability assessment support

### Operational Compliance
- Business process audit trails
- Data integrity verification
- Operational metrics collection
- Compliance reporting support

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Real-time notifications
- Enhanced security features
- Performance monitoring integration

### Scalability Improvements
- Microservices architecture preparation
- Event-driven architecture support
- Advanced caching mechanisms
- Database optimization strategies
